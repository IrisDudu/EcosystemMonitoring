# Four decades global ecosystem change revealed by annual functional mapping
Four decades global ecosystem change revealed by annual functional mapping
Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment highlighted human impacts on ecosystems, understanding how Earth’s ecosystems are changing in composition and condition has become central to global sustainable development agendas. Yet most global ecosystem maps remain static, preventing consistent temporal tracking and creating critical data gaps for evaluating progress under the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals. Here we present a globally consistent framework for annually mapping terrestrial ecosystem types and ecosystem functional groups (EFGs) from 1982 to 2024, aligned with the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology. We generate annual fractional EFG maps at 1 km resolution (overall accuracy = 86.14 ± 0.47%) and quantify ecosystem condition with an Ecosystem Quality Index (EQI). Our analysis reveals a sustained expansion of human-dominated functional groups, which represent the largest contributor to global EFG transitions (46.23%). High-frequency EFG transitions are concentrated in climate-sensitive drylands and polar regions, and belt-like patterns along zones of intense human–environment interaction and occurring sporadically across islands. Despite an overall tendency toward improvement across global terrestrial ecosystems (36.98% improved and 9.64% degraded), recovery is primarily driven by temperate forests, grasslands and intensive-used systems, whereas tropical natural ecosystems remain the weak and lagging component of global recovery. This dynamic dataset provides an operational foundation for global ecosystem monitoring, enabling timely biodiversity assessments, restoration planning, and integration into Earth system models.
